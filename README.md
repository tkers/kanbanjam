# KanBanJam

**Move tickets, make profits!** KanBanJam is a Jira-inspired strategy game made
during [Ludum Dare 50](https://ldjam.com/events/ludum-dare/50/kanbanjam).

Become the manager of a fantastic Kanban board. Assign tasks to your team,
implement new features to your product, and avoid upsetting our customers by
leaving too many bugs hanging.

Use your mouse to move tickets around the board. Simply drag a ticket from the
_backlog_ to the _todo_ column to nudge your team to start working on the task
at hand.

Keep an eye out for tickets that are _bugs_, if you donâ€™t fix them quickly
enough, your users will get upset (which is bad for business). At the same time,
also make sure to implement new features to delight your users (which
conversely, is good for business).
